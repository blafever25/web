    "text": "Note: In conjunction with Lina Saade (Mid Project Group #4)\nClick here for Video\n\nOriginal Visualization Analysis\n\nClick here for Original\n\nThe original visualization comes from a Wall Street Journal article entitled “What We Know About America’s Billionaires: 1,135 and Counting”, found here [1]. In the depiction, the reader finds that the writers have individualized every billionaire in America into estimated net worth (circles) and gender (color) and plotted onto a linear vertical axis depicting age at the time of writing [1]. Several notable billionaires are shown by name, however, most of the circles are unlabeled.\nStrengths of this visualization:\n\nAble to show all 1,135 billionaires with respective wealth, spread out and easy to view (when zoomed in).\nEasy relative comparison between circles\nAble to make quick generalizations about number, gender, and relative wealth across age ranges\n\nWeaknesses of this visualization:\n\nThere is a lot going on in the depiction making it difficult to focus on one thing.\nAnonymous information makes it difficult to compare two specific circles without additional context.\nCircle size is seemingly logarithmic making it difficult to be specific about wealth of any one circle.\nThe more circles in an age range, the more difficult to make any sort of comparison.\n\n\n\nSpecial Efforts\nI used ChatGPT 5 in order to summarize the count of circles, relative net worth of each circle, and the average net worth in each age range grouped by gender [2]. Initially, the counts the tool returned were clearly off, therefore, I had to prompt it with estimated numbers gained from visually counting the number of circles in each section. Additionally, the gender counts were off, so I added that to the prompt. Lastly, the article states that the collective wealth of these billionaires is roughly $5.7 trillion [1], so I added that to the prompt to ensure the math adds up in the end.\n\n\nRedesigned Visualization #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first redesign, I decided to focus on totals for all billionaires and analyze the differences across age ranges. Additionally, as an additional layer, I color coded the age ranges based on combined total net worth. I used the generated data set from [2] and used [3] and [4] in conjunction with packages [5]-[8] to create both of these redesigns. From this plot we can make some general observations:\n\nThe number of billionaires in their 60s is almost double the number in their 50s.\nThe combined total net worth of the billionaires in their 70s is more than those in their 60s despite the total number being lower.\n\nIf you compare this graph with the original visualization, these points would be more difficult to make as the number of circles becomes large. Additionally, the total net worth numbers are nearly impossible to discern from the original. I used ChatGPT [2] to visually count and interpret the total net worth from the legend given (i.e. size of the circle correlates to estimated net worth), there could be some error introduced which could skew the numbers. However, a visual analysis of the original would take a reader a long time to compute a number for total net worth in high-circle age ranges, therefore the potential error introduced with the numbers by ChatGPT is acceptable.\nNext steps for this might be to gather more exact data, perhaps attempting to more accurately quantify the net worth for individual circles. Additionally, there may be data that can help add context. This may add another dimension to the visualization. Lastly, there may be a better way to display this information. Perhaps a box diagram that could display quartiles or summary statistics in a better way.\n\n\nRedesigned Visualization #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the second redesign, I decided to focus on the the differences in gender, both in count and in average net worth per person. For this, I asked ChatGPT [2] to separate the count and net worth based on gender and then calculate the average net worth for both genders for each age range. I then used [3] and [4] in conjunction with packages [5]-[8], to create a 100% stacked plot showing the average net worth percentages in each age range. From this plot, we can make the following general observations:\n\nThe average net worth across males is higher in every age range, indicating that gender disparity may exist even at the billionaire level.\nAs age range goes up, average female net worth goes up while male net worth goes down. This could indicate older female billionaires either do better with investing or hold on to their wealth better than their male counterparts.\n\nComparing this visualization to the original, it would be impossible to discern the average net worth across all circles in a given age range where the number of circles is large. While there may be some skewing of numbers due to use of ChatGPT [2] and as discussed in Re-design #1, it is likely minimal. Additionally, whereas the gender disparity issue is more visually noticeable in this redesign, it is also fairly easy to discern in the original visualization if the reader is specifically looking for it. In age ranges with larger circles, however, it becomes more difficult in the original to definitively identify a gap between females and males.\nNext steps for this visualization might include being able to add the percentage of women in each category. The proportion that I chose to display here is that of net wealth relative to men, however, the proportion of women to men is also interesting given the original diagram. Some analysis of that may benefit going forward.\n\n\nReferences\n[1] “What We Know About America’s Billionaires: 1,135 and Counting.” Accessed: Oct. 19, 2025. [Online].
